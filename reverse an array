void reverseArray(vector<int> &arr) {
        int left = 0;  
        int right =arr.size() -1 ; 
        while (left < right){
            swap(arr[left],arr[right]);
            left++;
            right--; 
        }
    }
the logic behind is:
make ints left and right. set left to index 0, the start of arr, and set right to arr.size(i)-1 , so it takes the last element of the array.
have a while loop, with cond of (left < right)
while left is lesser than right, swap first elem and the last elem of the string.
left++, increment, so we go to center from left, i--, decrement, so we go to center from right
